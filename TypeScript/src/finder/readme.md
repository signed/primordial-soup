# Finder-Refactoring-Kata

Refactoring exercise focusing on naming.

- [Original exercise](https://github.com/OdeToCode/Katas/tree/master/Refactoring/Java) by K. Scott Allen.
- [PHP port](https://github.com/CodelyTV/php-finder_refactoring-kata) by CodelyTV.

## Introduction

Here is the bad news: the new developer you hired has written some terrible, atrocious code.
No one can understand what it does.

The good news: at least there are unit tests to prove the code is working.

You job is to refactor the code and make it readable, while keeping the code in working order (pass all tests).

## How To Start

Inside each language folder is a README with the (same) assignment.
